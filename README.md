# Tripsit Welcome Page

This serves the channel overview page on https://chat.tripsit.me/ and welcomes users to our chatrooms.

## How to run

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), after that run in your terminal in the repo's directory:

`npm install` - to install dependencies

`npm start` - to start the repo

The port can be found in the [www](https://github.com/TripSit/welcome/blob/master/bin/www) file in the repo's directory.

When you get this:

```
> welcome@0.0.0 start C:\Users\JungleMan\Desktop\tripsit-welcome
> node ./bin/www
```

it means the app is running and you can access it through the link: `http://localhost:[the port from www]/`
